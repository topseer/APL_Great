    "In this chapter we looked at Mathematical distributions. Mathematical distributions have a *generating story* (or many such stories) that describe processes that give rise to data with certain characteristics that appear over and over again. We need only provide specific *parameter* to specialize them for our own data. This makes them good models for our data, a point we will return to in a later chapter."
