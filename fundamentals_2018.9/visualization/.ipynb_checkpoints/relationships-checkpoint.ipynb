    "# Expressing Quantitative Relationships with Charts\n",

    "Note that these relationships are essentially *messages* or *stories* we want to convey about our data. We might want to tell several stories about a particular variable. This implies that you want *one chart per message*. Do not make charts tell more than one story. This is the problem with the Playfair chart. It is telling a Time Series story about the Exports and Imports of England and a Difference story about the Trade Balance. This should be two charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these concepts will be clearer when we start Exploratory Data Analysis. This section is mostly to plant seeds for later. We'll take up these different approaches when we start EDA.\n",
