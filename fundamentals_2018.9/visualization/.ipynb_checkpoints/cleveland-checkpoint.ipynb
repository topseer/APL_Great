    "# Cleveland's Research on Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In their paper, *Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods*, William S. Cleveland and Robert McGill set out to determine, *by experiment*, what encodings were most accurate for *decoding* information. The results were expounded upon in Cleveland's book, *The Elements of Graphing Data*. Their results are generally considered the starting point for all evidence-based discussions about the visualizations and static charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that charts represent an encoding of data to be decoded by viewers originates with Cleveland and therefore his experiments attempted to answer the following question, **\"Of all the possible ways of encoding data, what encodings lead to the most accurate decodings?\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "The encodings he studied were as follows (at the time they were called \"perceptual tasks\"):"

    "* **Position on a common scale** includes both scatter plots and bar charts. For example, the bar chart I drew at the start of the notebook has all the bars positioned on a common scale. \n",
    "* **Position on non-aligned scales** is best exemplified by the example Excel chart. When we go to compare the red and purple bars we can see that they are not on aligned scales. \n",
    "* **Length** is a general feature of bar charts. \n",
    "* **Direction** is related to line charts and charts using line direction to encode relationships. \n",

    "* **Area**, especially circular area, covers what are often called \"triple scatter plots\" or \"bubble charts\" made famous by Hans Rosling's TED talk. \n",
    "* **Volume** addresses 3d charts made infamous by Excel. \n",

    "## Experiment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first experiment, Cleveland looked into the difference between *position* and *length*. He did this by having subjects decode values from bar charts and stacked bar charts. In a bar chart, the value can be decoded from a bar simply by looking at the top of the bar and comparing it against the y-axis. The viewer only needs *position*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a stacked bar chart, for anything other than the bottom \"slice\", the view must use *length* as well as position. They must judge the position of the bottom of the slice and the position of the top of the slice. It gets somewhat worse when two slices on different bars are being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a lot of non-standard language surrounding \"bar charts\". *Most* of the time, a bar chart refers to what is often called a *horizontal bar chart*. In a horizontal bar chart, the bars run from left to right. A *vertical bar chart* is when the bars run from bottom to top. This is also called a \"columnar chart\" or \"column chart\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For Cleveland (and this text), a bar chart is a vertical bar chart (no need to specify \"vertical\") and the left to right variant is a horizontal bar chart."

    "The results are reported below. Because the results were log-normally distributed (something we'll talk about in a later chapter), Cleveland reported log base 2 absolute error. He chose base 2 because errors do not generally change in increments of 10 (so a log base 10 scale didn't help anything). The dot represents the *midmean* or the mean of the interquartile range. The line represents the 95% confidence interval. For now, we can interpret the confidence interval in a Bayesian way and say that, based on the data, there is a 95% probability that the midmean lies in the region. (This is not, however, the Frequentist interpretation)."

However, if you simply want to make good charts *based* on the results, you can do better by reading Stephen Few. Nevertheless, I will report on one of the most interesting results where the main story is the *difference* between two curves. We will call such charts \"curve-difference charts\". They are essentially line charts with two (or more) lines showing magnitudes (exports, imports in this case) but the *message* is the difference (trade balance).\n",
